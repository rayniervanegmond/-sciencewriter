**A package to support writing of scientific articles by maintaining argumentation consistency combined with external reference management.**

The purpose of this component is to provide a library that will support the authoring of academic papers based on the argumentation development model explained in the book by Booth, Coloms and Williams (abbrev. BCM), The Craft of Research. 

Like many I found this book indispensible to writing solid papers but always thought that it would be great if there was an application that; like a bibliography management application, would maintain the consistency of the argumentation model for a particular paper.

The objective I have for this library component is that it will help (aspiring) academic authors write better and internally consistent papers. The purpose for this component is that it will take care of the internal consistency management and (external evidence references) so that other can write application based on the BCM argumentation model.

## Features

-   Develop the argumentation information model on which the application will be based.
-   Develop the consistency validation feature that ensure the argmentation of the paper in sound.
-   Develop the analysis feature that reports on missing or incomplete pieces in the argumentation.
-   Develop the suggestion feature that uses the analysis to suggest improvements.
